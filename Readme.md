## Requesting a development kit

You can [request a Pico Goblin](/docs/pico-development-kit.md) to help get your VR experiences Pico-compatible.

## Prerequisites

The minimum supported version of Unity is V5.2.

You will require the following in order to develop a Pico app

* A version of Unity 5.2 or greater (tested up to 2017.2.0) - there are known issues with Unity5.3.5f1.
* Either an Android 4.4 (or later) phone running Android API Level 19 or above, or a Pico Goblin headset
* JDK v1.7.0_01 or later

## Overview

You can easily create a new Unity VR app, but the fastest way to get up and running on Pico Goblin is to convert an existing Google Cardboard, Google Daydream or Samsung Gear VR experience.

* [Installing and configuring the Pico VR Unity SDK](/docs/pico-vr-unity-sdk-installation.md)
