# Pico Unity SDK Instructions

Instructions for creating new Unity VR experiences (or porting existing ones) for the Pico Goblin headset for submission through WEARVR to the Chinese and global Pico stores.

## Requesting a development kit

You can [request a Pico Goblin](/docs/pico-development-kit.md) to help get your VR experiences Pico-compatible.

## Prerequisites

The minimum supported version of Unity is V5.2.

You will require the following in order to develop a Pico app

* A version of Unity 5.2 or greater (tested up to 2017.2.0) - there are known issues with Unity5.3.5f1.
* Either an Android 4.4 (or later) phone running Android API Level 19 or above, or a Pico Goblin headset
* JDK v1.7.0_01 or later

## Quick start

You can easily create a new Unity VR app, but the fastest way to get up and running on Pico Goblin is to convert an existing Google Cardboard, Google Daydream or Samsung Gear VR experience.

[Get started](/docs/installation.md) with the Pico VR Unity SDK.
